- Right now base manifolds are implicitly differentiable manifolds

  - Explicitly define topological manifold
  - Extend this to differentiable manifold with tangent spaces
  - Write Connection etc. in terms of differentiable manifold

- Mapping vectors in tangent space to displacements on manifolds

  - Trivial for R^n, just 'add' the vector to the manifold point
  - For Lie group manifolds, use an exponential map
  - For curved manifolds, use parallel transport connection
